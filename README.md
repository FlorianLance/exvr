## Description

ExVR is a software for creating and executing 3D/2D complexes experiments base on Unity3D using virtual reality or not. 

Its philosophy is roughly based on [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/) and can easily be extended by users, it allows to create a pipeline of different routines, ISI using loops for generating a randomization based on conditions. To each condition we can associate any number of components (theses ones can be anything, an image, a sound, a script, a 3D scene...) with timelines and specific configurations.
Communication between components can be done using scripting (C# or Python) or by using visual scripting with nodes and connections.

## Origin

The project has been developped at [EPFL LNCO laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lnco/) (Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience) and has been funded by the [EPFL Open Science Fund](https://www.epfl.ch/research/open-science/in-practice/open-science-fund/) from the 2019 cohort. It has been used for dozains of experiments and demos inside LNCO or during external collaborations since it creation in 2018.


## Content

**ExVR** is subdivided in two software:
* **ExVR-designer**: a GUI for creating the experiments and controlling their execution
  * creation
    * experimental flow (routines, loops, interstimulus state)
    * components, configurations and their parameters
    * randomization of the differents loops
    * management of resources (scripts, images, sounds, 3D objects..)
    * actions (association of conditions and components using update/visibility timelines)   
    * scripting using (C#,Python)
    * visual scripting using nodes
    * global settings (display options and others)
    * generation of the differents randomization (using instances files)
    * saving/eport/loading functions
  * execution
    * load current exp (or a subpart) to the launcher
    * load default or specific randomization (using instance files)
    * play/pause/stop/next/previous/goto
    * feedback (exp stae, time, routine name, nodes states) from the exp-launcher
    * logs (messages, errors) from the software and the scripts
    * realtime update of components parameters
* **ExVR-exp**: an exp launcher for executing experiments
  * runtime generation for experiments from two xml files generated by the designer:
    * experiment file -> for the content
    * instance file  -> for the randomization
